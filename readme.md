# GTM Lite-Vimeo Module

Because Lite-Vimeo makes use of the Shadow DOM, the original code for this can't be used as-is, so this repo allows users to modify the JS and handle things in a modern convention, while still getting transpiled to ES2015 (which GTM supports).

## At a Glance

The `/dist/gtm/index.js` file is what you need.

## Getting Started

-   Copy the `gtm/index.js` into Google Tag Manager
