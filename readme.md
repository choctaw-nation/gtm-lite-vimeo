# GTM Lite-Vimeo Module

Because Lite-Vimeo makes use of the Shadow DOM, the original code for this can't be used as-is, so this repo allows users to modify the JS and handle things in a modern convention, while still getting transpiled to ES2015 (which GTM supports).

## Getting Started

-   Copy the `gtm/index.js` into Google Tag Manager

---

# Changelog

## v1.0.0

-   init!
